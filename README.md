## Problem Statement ##
With VH360°, we're looking to solve the problem of individuals losing touch with their high schools both during attendance and after they graduate. Core memories are formed during these years, and there should be a place to share, view, and reflect on them that's personalized to the specific school. What makes VH360° even more unique compared to popular social media sites is the fact that it's ad-free and isn't focused on content performance. It's simply an archive reserved for students, which must be proven using credentials. This gives it a school-centric, preservationist style. 

## AI Integration ##
We plan to integrate AI into VH360° for content moderation. Our goal is to share appropriate, safe memories, and we intend to use a video analysis tool, like TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers. While neither of us have exprience with these tools, we believe this goal is feasible because of the tools' popularity and widespread documentation.

Our project is now nearing completion. The site is capable of showing videos and images, and we are working on allowing users to send in content. Some features that have yet to be finalized are the login feature, the dashboard, and the contact page. The contact page will be completed very soon and we are using EmailJs to create this feature. the Login and dashboard feature go hand-in-hand and can be installed as soon as we put in payment information in to google cloud.
