## Problem Statement ##
With VH360°, we're looking to solve the problem of individuals losing touch with their high schools both during attendance and after they graduate. Core memories are formed during these years, and there should be a place to share, view, and reflect on them that's personalized to the specific school.

## AI Integration ##
We plan to integrate AI into VH360° for content moderation. Our goal is to share appropriate, safe memories, and we intend to use a video analysis tool, like TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers. While neither of us have exprience with these tools, we believe this goal is feasible because of the tools' popularity and widespread documentation.
